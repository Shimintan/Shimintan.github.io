Hi everyone, my twine story is on The sweating disease that appears during the tudor period. Henry VIII was the one who was most involved so I included some details about him, I expained what the disease was, what might have caused the disease, what the effects of the disease was, etc. I also included the smyptons and all of the years where it merged.I talked about Henry VIII, how he protected himself anf included his love one, Anna. There is a seperate passage about them during the disease. For Henry, I explained how he protected himself and reacted to his love one catching the disease. For Anna, i had information about her getting he disease and what the results were.

I did all the mini assignments, except for mini assignment 6. One file included mini assignment 1,2,3,and 4. Mini assignment 5 and 7 was in different files with different names. There are pictures, videos, color change, texh box in the story

Thank you
